Title : pre school learning app with parental control
the main menu of the app has a category, admin and settings
the categories are: alphabets, number, shape, animals, place, vehicles
for now you can do just two categories alphabets and number
for the alphabets, the alphabets will slide from a to z with sounds
same with numbers from 1-20 with sounds
so for categories its like just a demo
in the admin button
the user or the mother can create an account
after she creates an account
those are the categories again but that is different. this time its an exam with scores
when you are and admin you will have different categories that you can give to your kid/ user
if you click the rumbled alphabets
You will go to this exam

thats on the admin
this should have a check button. if the user/kid is finish. the score will pop up
that is the feature of the first app
you can just do 2 categories and two exam for the admin for now. you can complete after
because the submission of the app will be on Monday for just checking some feature
